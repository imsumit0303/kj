SMS charges as per Your mobile operator may be charged. Thereafter, You will see an interface asking You to select Your bank. 
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-weight: 500 !important;">Selecting Your bank :</p>

                      <li> Select Your bank from the list of UPI-member banks listed on our App. The list comprises all the banks connected to the UPI Platform. NPCI may update the list from time to time.
                      </li>

                      <li>
                        If the name of Your bank does not appear in the list, You can still add Your bank by providing the bank account number and the IFSC code. You will not be able send money to someone or make payment to a merchant through UPI from Your bank account, but You can receive funds from others into Your bank account.
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="text-justify">
                      Please note that Your mobile number should be registered with Your bank. If Your mobile number is not registered, then You will not be able to avail the UPI services. Please first register Your mobile number with the Bank.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-justify">After You select Your bank from the list, You will see the last few digits of Your bank account number(s) registered with Your mobile number. You need to select the bank account which You wish to link with KHAALIJEB.</p>

                    <p class="text-justify">
                      Mobile Personal Identification Number <strong>(MPIN):</strong> If You already have the 4-6 digit MPIN for Your bank account, then You can start transacting through UPI. If You do not remember the MPIN, You can click on “Forgot MPIN” and set a new one by providing the card number and expiry date of the debit card linked with Your bank account. Your mobile number will be OTP verified by Your bank. If the verification is successful, You will be taken to the NPCI page, to set a new MPIN. You can change Your MPIN anytime by clicking on “Change MPIN”. You can then set a new MPIN by providing the old and new MPINs on NPCI page. If You have never set the MPIN before, then You will see a “Set MPIN” option.

                    <p>Since Your mobile number is treated as the primary identifier, Your mobile number needs to be updated with the bank in case of any changes.</p>

                    <p class="text-justify">If You change the mobile number registered with Your KHAALIJEB Account, You will have to re-register Your new mobile number with KHAALIJEB. To re-activate UPI services, You first need to register Your new mobile number with Your bank and then link Your bank account all over again with KHAALIJEB.</p>

                    <p>Per Transaction limit set my NPCI for UPI is INR 1 lakhs. There is no monthly limit.</p>
